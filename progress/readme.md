# Progress

This folder has screenshots of various milestones in the development of the development of this raytracer, so I can see how far I've come.

|![001_first.png](./001_first.png)      | 2021-01-06T01:32 | The first image generated by the render loop, before we even have any actual raytraces
|![002_gradient.png](./002_gradient.png)| 2021-01-06T01:36 | A gradient in the x direction, to confirm we're writing meaningful data to the film
|![003_color.png](./003_color.png)      | 2021-01-06T02:11 | Added Spectrum color to the film and ray tracer, along with a sample gradient
|![004_sphere.png](./004_sphere.png)    | 2021-01-06T21:35 | Ray->Sphere intersections, along with tweaking the rays generated by the camera
|![005_shading.png](./005_shading.png)  | 2021-01-06T23:23 | Hacked in a simple shading method to test the sphere intersection normal calculation
|![006_shading.png](./006_many.png)     | 2021-01-07T02:15 | Added a simple PrimitiveList shape for multiple objects, and implemented point lights
|![007_fov.png](./007_fov.png)          | 2021-01-15T02:35 | Implements camera transforms for a perspective camera correctly, so we can have field-of-view
